# BUDGETING APP - PRD

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile budgeting application that automatically distributes paychecks across user-defined financial goals without requiring bank account integration. The application addresses the core challenge of proactive budget allocation by providing a flexible, privacy-focused envelope budgeting system that adapts to diverse financial situations and pay schedules.

### Problem Statement

Traditional budgeting applications often fail users by requiring complex setup processes, mandating bank account connections that raise privacy concerns, or forcing rigid budgeting methodologies that do not accommodate varying income schedules and financial priorities. Users need a solution that provides automatic paycheck distribution across their financial goals while maintaining complete control over their data and financial privacy.

Current market solutions typically require users to either track expenses retroactively or link bank accounts for automatic categorization. This approach creates barriers for users who prefer manual control, have irregular income, or prioritize financial data privacy.

### Solution Overview

The application implements a forward-looking envelope budgeting system where users define financial goals with target amounts and timelines. Upon paycheck entry, the system calculates optimal distribution across all envelopes to maintain progress toward each goal while protecting essential cushion amounts and directing surplus funds according to user preferences.

The solution distinguishes itself through complete configurability, privacy-first design, and accommodation of any income frequency or financial structure. Users maintain full control over their data while receiving intelligent automated calculations for paycheck allocation.

## User Personas and Use Cases

#### Primary Persona: The Proactive Budgeter

Individual who receives regular paychecks and wants to ensure bills and savings goals are met without manual calculation. Values privacy and prefers not to link bank accounts. Seeks simplicity in budget management while maintaining control over financial priorities.

#### Secondary Persona: The Irregular Income Earner

Freelancer, contractor, or commission-based worker with variable income who needs flexible budgeting that adapts to different paycheck amounts. Requires system that can handle multiple income sources and varying payment schedules.

#### Tertiary Persona: The Financial Goal Tracker

User focused on specific savings targets for major purchases, debt payoff, or emergency fund building. Needs clear progress visualization and ability to adjust priorities as circumstances change.
